### **System Requirements Document**

#### **1. Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Video Upload:** Users must be able to upload video files of various formats and sizes.
*   **FR2: Resumable Uploads:** The system must support resumable uploads, allowing users to continue an upload that has been interrupted by network issues without starting over.
*   **FR3: Video Streaming:** Users must be able to play uploaded videos from any device.
*   **FR4: Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS):** The video player must dynamically adjust the streaming quality (e.g., from 4K down to 240p) in real-time based on the user's network bandwidth to ensure smooth, continuous playback.
*   **FR5: Video Processing/Transcoding:** The system must process uploaded videos and convert them into multiple resolutions and formats to support adaptive bitrate streaming and ensure compatibility across a wide range of devices.

#### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NFR1: High Availability:** The platform must be highly available and resilient to failures. Both uploading and streaming services should have minimal downtime.
*   **NFR2: High Durability:** Once a video is uploaded, it should never be lost. The system must guarantee the durability of the original and transcoded video files.
*   **NFR3: Scalability:** The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle a massive number of concurrent uploads and millions of simultaneous video viewers. It should manage significant traffic growth without a degradation in performance.
*   **NFR4: Low Latency:** Video playback must start quickly (low time to first frame), and seeking to different parts of the video should be nearly instantaneous.
*   **NFR5: Efficiency and Parallelism:** The video processing pipeline must be highly efficient to make videos available for viewing as quickly as possible after upload. This requires massive parallelization of tasks.
*   **NFR6: Global Content Delivery:** The system must deliver video content to a global audience with low latency, regardless of the viewer's geographic location.
