### **Project Requirement Document (PRD): Streamify Video Platform**

*   **Version:** v1.0.0
*   **Date:** 21 September 2025  

#### **1. Introduction and System Goals**

Streamify is a large-scale video streaming platform designed to provide a robust, reliable, and high-performance experience for uploading and viewing video content.

The primary goals of the system are:

*   **Deliver an Uncompromising Upload Experience:** Enable users to upload large video files reliably and efficiently, regardless of network instability.
*   **Provide Broadcast-Quality Video Playback:** Ensure a seamless, high-quality viewing experience with minimal startup delay and no buffering, adaptable to any device and network condition.
*   **Build a Scalable, Global, and Resilient Architecture:** Engineer a foundational platform capable of serving a worldwide user base, handling exponential traffic growth, and guaranteeing the highest levels of availability and data durability.

#### **2. Functional Requirements (FRs)**

*   **FR1: Multi-Format Video Upload**
    *   **Description:** Users must be able to upload video files. The system shall support common consumer and prosumer video formats (e.g., MP4, MOV, WebM, AVI). The system must be designed to handle large file sizes, with an initial target of supporting files up to 100 GB.

*   **FR2: Resumable and Reliable Uploads**
    *   **Description:** The upload process must be resilient to network interruptions. Users must be able to resume an interrupted upload—due to network changes, browser closure, or other failures—from the point of failure without having to re-upload the entire file.

*   **FR3: Adaptive Bitrate Playback**
    *   **Description:** All videos must be streamable using an adaptive bitrate protocol (e.g., HLS). The client-side video player must automatically detect the user's current network bandwidth and seamlessly switch between available video quality streams (from 240p up to 4K) to prevent buffering and optimize the viewing experience.

*   **FR4: Automated Video Processing Pipeline**
    *   **Description:** Upon a successful upload, the system must automatically trigger a processing pipeline. This pipeline will transcode the single source video into multiple resolutions and codecs optimized for adaptive bitrate streaming. The output must include all necessary video segments and manifest files required for playback.

#### **3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

*   **NFR1: High Availability**
    *   **Description:** The system's core services (upload initiation, metadata API, playback manifest delivery) shall have a minimum uptime of **99.99%**. The architecture must be resilient to single AWS Availability Zone (AZ) failures with no data loss and minimal service interruption.

*   **NFR2: Data Durability**
    *   **Description:** All uploaded video assets (both original and transcoded files) must be stored with a durability of **99.999999999%** (11 nines), ensuring no data is lost after a successful upload.

*   **NFR3: Scalability and Elasticity**
    *   **Description:** The platform must be able to scale horizontally to meet variable demand.
        *   **Uploads:** Support up to **10,000 concurrent video uploads**.
        *   **Playback:** Serve up to **1 million concurrent video viewers**.
        *   **Elasticity:** All services, particularly the transcoding fleet, must automatically scale up to meet peak demand and scale down (potentially to zero) during idle periods to ensure cost-efficiency.

*   **NFR4: Low Latency Performance**
    *   **Description:** The system must be highly responsive to user interactions.
        *   **API Latency:** All API requests for metadata must have a Time to First Byte (TTFB) of less than **200ms at the 95th percentile**.
        *   **Playback Start Time:** The time from a user clicking "play" to the first frame of video appearing must be less than **2 seconds**.
        *   **Global Delivery:** Video segment TTFB for users in major global markets (North America, Europe, Asia) must be under **300ms at the 95th percentile**.

*   **NFR5: Processing Efficiency**
    *   **Description:** The video processing pipeline must make content available for viewing quickly. A 10-minute, 1080p video upload must be available for streaming in at least one standard resolution (720p) within **5 minutes** of the upload's completion.

#### **4. Out of Scope**

The following features are explicitly out of scope for this version of the system design:
*   User account creation, authentication, and profile management.
*   Video search, discovery, and recommendation algorithms.
*   User-facing features such as comments, likes, and playlists.
*   Monetization features, including advertising and subscriptions.
*   Live streaming capabilities.
*   Digital Rights Management (DRM) and content protection.
